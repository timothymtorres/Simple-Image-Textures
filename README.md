#Simple Image Textures

*Simple Image Textures* (SIT) is a library used to quickly load image sheets into CoronaSDK with [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker).  Instead of having to manually load each individual image sheet into a project, this library loads them all into a table for easy access.  Just point SIT to the directory(s) where the resources are located and it does all the heavy lifting.

I created SIT initially as a added feature for another library called [Berry](https://github.com/ldurniat/Berry).  After the feature was added, I decided to also make it into a stand alone tool that other developers (hopefully) might find useful.

### Quick Start Guide

```lua
local SIT = require('simple_image_textures')
SIT.new(directory)  -- ie. graphics/images/stuff

image = display.newImageRect( SIT.getTexture(texture_name) )
image.x, image.y = 100, 100
```

### SIT.new(directory)

SIT will scan through the given directory and all sub-directories for Texturepacker files and load them.  **Both the matching Texturepacker image and lua files provided must have the same name and be in the same directory**.

### SIT.getTexture(name)

This returns an image sheet, frame, width, and height for a texturepack image.  Simply pass the name of the image to the method like so: `display.newImageRect( SIT.getTexture('crowbar'))` (assuming image is named crowbar.png) and you will have a quick image to load.  No need to deal with multiple image sheets, sizes, or frames.
